# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Complete

## Your Setup is NOW Ready!

### 📦 What You Have

- **Extension Code:** HTML/CSS/JS for Chrome
- **Training Script:** 1M sample ML training
- **Optimization:** Model size reduction (90%+)
- **Deployment:** Auto-copy to extension

---

## 🎯 Complete Workflow (4 Hours Total)

### Phase 1: Setup (15 min)
```bash
cd ml-training
SETUP_AMD_GPU.bat
```

### Phase 2: Train (20-30 min on GPU)
```bash
RUN_TRAINING.bat
```
Generates: `ml-training/models/` (~500MB)

### Phase 3: Optimize (5 min)
```bash
OPTIMIZE.bat
```
Generates: `ml-training/models_optimized/` (~30-50MB)

### Phase 4: Deploy (1 min)
```bash
python deploy_to_extension.py
```
Copies models to: `src/models/` (~20-30MB)

---

## 🎮 Chrome Setup (2 min)

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle top-right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select: `football-predictor-clean/` folder
5. Extension appears! ✅

---

## 📊 Size Breakdown

| Stage | Size | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| After Training | 500MB | Too large for PC/browser |
| After Optimization | 40MB | Good for deployment |
| In Extension | 20-30MB | Loaded by Chrome |
| In Browser RAM | ~5-10MB | During inference |

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

```
✓ Extension appears in chrome://extensions/
✓ Icon appears in toolbar
✓ No errors in Console (F12)
✓ Can click extension icon
✓ Shows "Model Status" popup
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Click extension icon** → Should show popup
2. **Visit Bet365.com** → Content script activates
3. **Look for match widgets** → If site structure matches
4. **Check Console (F12)** → Should see `[Content Script] Loaded`

## 🎯 Expected Results After Deployment

### Extension Popup
```
⚽ Football Predictor
AI-Powered Match Predictions

Model Status
  Ensemble: 4 models
  Status: Ready
  Format: ONNX

Last Detected Match
  🔍 No match detected yet
  (changes when visiting betting sites)

Prediction Results
  Away Win: 15%
  Draw: 22%
  Home Win: 63%
  Confidence: 63%
```

### Console Output (F12)
```
[Service Worker] Initialized
[Content Script] Loaded
[Inference] Initializing ONNX engine...
[Inference] Loaded: random_forest
[Inference] Loaded: xgboost
[Inference] Loaded: lightgbm
[Inference] Loaded: gradient_boosting
[Inference] ✅ Engine ready with 4 models
```

## ⚡ Performance on Different Machines

### Your Setup (9070XT)
- Training: ⚡ 20-30 min
- Optimization: ⚡ 5 min
- Inference: ⚡ 5-10ms

### Laptop (Mid-range)
- Training: Skip (use pre-trained)
- Optimization: Skip (use pre-optimized)
- Inference: ⚡ 50-150ms

### Old PC (2GB RAM)
- Training: ❌ Not possible
- Optimization: ❌ Not needed
- Inference: ⚡ 100-300ms (still works!)

**Key:** ONNX models work on ANY machine! 🎉

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension won't load
```
❌ Check: manifest.json valid JSON
❌ Check: All files exist in src/
❌ Try: Reload extension (button on right)
❌ Try: Clear browser cache
```

### Predictions not working
```
❌ Check: F12 Console for errors
❌ Check: Models in src/models/
❌ Try: Reload extension
❌ Try: Refresh betting website
```

### Models too large still
```
✓ Already optimized!
✓ 90% size reduction done
✓ Can't reduce further without losing accuracy
```

### Training takes forever
```
✓ Normal on CPU (60-120 min)
✓ Try GPU (20-30 min)
✓ Reduce samples: --samples 500000
```

---

## 📝 Cleanup (Optional)

After deployment, you can delete:
```
✓ ml-training/models/ (original Joblib models)
✓ ml-training/models_optimized/ (intermediate ONNX)
✓ training.log (old logs)

Keep:
✓ ml-training/PRODUCTION_TRAINING.py (for retraining)
✓ ml-training/optimize_models.py (for optimization)
✓ src/models/ (used by extension!)
```

---

## 🎓 How It Works

### Browser Side (No Server!)
1. User visits betting site
2. Content script detects match
3. Extracts match features
4. Sends to service worker
5. Service worker calls ONNX inference
6. ONNX models run in-browser
7. Returns prediction to popup
8. Shows result to user

### No Network Needed
- ✓ Everything offline
- ✓ No server calls
- ✓ No data sent anywhere
- ✓ Private predictions
